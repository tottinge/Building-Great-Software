Why Write This Book?
====================

There are many books out in the world for beginners, and
many of them are fine books. Everyone who programs is tempted
to write a book for beginners, partly because they know how
hard it was for them to start and how exciting. 

It is hard partly because we all think differently, and the books
don't line up with how we think quite right. As a result, there is
always going to be a market for a book that takes a different 
approach.

We're going to do this "the wrong way," by starting with big
ideas and explaining them simply instead of building up from
simple mechanical operations (click this, type that) and stopping
before the topic becomes interesting.

This book is for someone who isn't stupid, but never programmed. It
is especially apropriate for them if they want to learn to program
well.

If you are a programmer, then this will make sense to you: we're not
dumbing it down. We're going to start with object-oriented, test-driven,
well-crafted code. We're going to talk about coupling, cohesion, naming,
testing, abstraction, and volatility even if we don't introduce the
words right away.

If you're not a programmer, hopefully you've come to the right place.
